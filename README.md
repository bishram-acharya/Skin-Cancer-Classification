# Introduction to ISIC dataset 
ISIC dataset is aimed to improve melanoma diagnosis. It provides the largest publicly available collection of quality controlled dermoscopic images of skin lesions. 

Beginning in 2016, ISIC has organized annual challenges for the computer science community, aiming to advance melanoma diagnosis through machine learning and computer vision. These challenges have evolved over the years, focusing on diagnostic accuracy, out-of-distribution problems, and the impact of clinical context. By 2018, algorithms surpassed clinicians in melanoma diagnosis, attracting global participation. The ISIC Archive, the largest publicly available collection of dermoscopic images, contains over 13,000 quality-controlled images, vetted by melanoma experts. This centralized dataset, combined with growing research on automated dermoscopic analysis, provides an invaluable resource for developing robust, AI-powered skin cancer detection algorithms.

# Problem Addressed  
Skin cancer is a major public health problem, with Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, had over 330,000 new cases globally in 2023. Due to resource constraints it is not possible to conduct. Automated diagnosis of melanoma is crucial because melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, responsible for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection is vital, as survival rates exceed 95% if caught in the early stages. However, diagnosing melanoma can be challenging due to its visual similarity to benign lesions, leading to missed or late diagnoses.

# Dataset Description
The dataset for ISIC 2019 contains 25,331 images available for the classification of dermoscopic images among nine different diagnostic categories:

- Melanoma
- Melanocytic nevus
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Actinic keratosis
- Benign keratosis (solar lentigo / seborrheic keratosis / lichen planus-like keratosis)
- Dermatofibroma
- Vascular lesion
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- None of the above
